# Build a News Email Digest App using Python and API (or)
# Automated Daily News Digest Emails

## Project Description

This project automates the process of collecting daily news articles and sending them via email. It retrieves news data using the NewsAPI, formats the news into an email digest, and sends it to a specified email address. The digest includes the latest headlines and their descriptions, ensuring you stay updated with current events.

## Process

1. **Retrieve News Data:**
   - Use the NewsAPI to fetch news articles based on a specified query (e.g., "apple").
   - Set parameters such as date range, sort order, and language to filter the news.

2. **Process News Data:**
   - Extract titles, descriptions, and URLs from the retrieved articles.
   - Format the news into a digest-friendly string, including subject lines and article details.

3. **Send Email:**
   - Use the `smtplib` library to send the formatted news digest as an email.
   - Configure SMTP settings for Gmail to send the email securely.

4. **Output:**
   - The email is sent to the designated recipient with the latest news digest.

## Technology Used

- **NewsAPI:** For fetching news articles and related information.
- **Requests:** To handle HTTP requests for retrieving news data.
- **smtplib:** For sending emails via SMTP.
- **SSL:** For securing the connection to the SMTP server.
- **Python:** The programming language used for scripting the news retrieval and email sending processes.

## What I Learned

- **API Integration:**
  - Gained experience in integrating with third-party APIs to fetch and process data.
  - Improved skills in handling JSON responses and extracting relevant information.

- **Email Automation:**
  - Learned how to use Pythonâ€™s `smtplib` to send emails programmatically.
  - Acquired knowledge of SMTP and SSL for secure email communication.

- **Data Formatting:**
  - Enhanced skills in formatting and structuring data for email content.
  - Developed an understanding of string manipulation and data presentation.

## Future Insights

- **Enhancements:**
  - Extend functionality to support multiple news sources or categories.
  - Implement scheduling to automate the daily sending of news digests at specific times.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Improve error handling for scenarios such as API request failures or email sending issues.
  - Add logging for debugging and monitoring the email sending process.

- **User Interaction:**
  - Develop a web or desktop interface for users to customize their news digest preferences.
  - Allow users to choose different topics or sources for their daily news updates.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how the news digest is generated and sent:
- `main.py` for fetching news and formatting the email content.
- `send_mail.py` for handling email sending.
